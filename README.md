# Arduino-based-Virtual-Instrumentation-Suite

This processing code(ARVIS.pde) allows the user to generate an arduino code for a software-oscilloscope which takes readings from 
the user-specified Arduino's digital and analog pins. The oscilloscope output can be viewed on GUI created by another 
processing code(oscilloscope.pde).

Note:
1) When oscilloscope.pde runs the arduino should be connected to a COM port.
2)ARVIS.pde and green.jpg should be kept in same processing sketch book folder for the program to run.
